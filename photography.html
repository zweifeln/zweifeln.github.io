<p>In 2016 I started exploring photography by buying a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera. After some time I discovered my passion for catching expressions in humans and small stories in pictures.</p>

<p>I am available for bookings of events as conferences, parties, demonstrations - as well as photo shootings with single models or small groups of people.</p>


<p>I'm an attentive observer and catch thoughts, worry, laughter, or joy of a person/a group of people rather than camera smiles. Camera smiles tell no story.</p>

<p>For events it means I  stay in the background so I'm not disturbing whatever is going on. I catch the atmosphere  and occasionally turn my camera from the stage to the audience.</p>

<p>For shootings I want the model to feel comfortable and I catch their expressions and feels in my pictures rather than telling them what to do - but if needed Iâ€™m barely short on ideas what to do in a shooting.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> was set in place in May 2018 and since then it's quite a debate how it's still okay to take pictures at conferences.
My solution is a variation of <a href="https://offlinetags.wordpress.com/">"offline tags"</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012 a Berlin based think tank developed a system of buttons to be automatically recognised by a software and edited (either face blurred or gave a note to not take a picture. The software worked only as a prototype demonstration - but the more interesting part for events is: you can give all attendants either buttons or stickers to mark themselves as either "want to be photographed" or "don't want to be photographed".
If there is a badge it could also be possible to have two versions of a badge with either "no photos" or "yes to photos" or some easy to understand symbol.</p>

<p>As your photographer I'm happy to follow these rules and will take care that no face of someone with a "no photo" tag will be in any of the sorted pictures.</p>
