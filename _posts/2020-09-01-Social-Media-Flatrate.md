Social Media Flatrate

What if Social Media were to run on a flatrate model instead of ads?

The thought itself is somewhat old. When Twitter started ads years ago I occasionally heard people suggest to pay for an ad free version. Maybe 5€/month or something.
There were porjects like app.net that charged their users … and ultimately failed as projects.
Though they charged all users for the service they provided - not for the service other users provided. That was always seen as a free gift.

Over the years influencers became quite a thing. Patreon got pretty popular too.

The porn scene is shifiting to <a href="https://onlyfans.com/">OnlyFans</a> and <a href="https://justfor.fans/">JustFor.Fans</a>.

What that tells me: it's not just the servers that need payment. It's also the content creators. Creation is a job and needs to be paid somehow. Social media became an advertising platform not just the platforms with paid ads themselves but also for the creatives. They use their social media to sell things too - may it be the product they are paid for to advertise, patreon, gofundme or their onlyfans.

And between all that social media - particularely Twitter - became a toxic shithole. Between all the ads for good and less good reasons, there's a huge political fight on the whole platform.

There are many opinions regarding whether the platform itself should take a stronger stand or whether it's freedom of speech.

I don't believe that political fight can be solved on that platform. I believe whatever Twitter may decide one day, it will be wrong for their platform. They became that platform. That fighting pit. I believe Twitter, as the fun and informative platform it once was, is lost.

Twitter and Facebook value debate more that support. Comments rank higher than likes or shares/retweets. The common explanation is, that comments make people stay longer on the platform and the longer people stay on the platform the more ads the platform can sell. So, social media these days are meant to create debates. They are meant to create fights. The toxic shithole it became is wanted as it creates revenue.

"Enemy observation" is a thing. Observe what the people you hate do, so you can react faster to whatever wrongdoing they commit.

Occasionally, I see people encouraging agaist that, that is encouragements to not follow one's enemies since even just following someone is already some kind of support. It still pushes their ideas and makes their accounts bigger. And yet, "enemy observation" stays a common thing.

Now, what would happen if we were to pay the people we follow? All of them? An equal amount?
Would you still follow your enemies knowing you would have to pay them?

What if social media would be a flatrate model not just for paying the tech and servers, but also the creators?
What if we all were to pay e.g. 10€/month, and these 10€ would cover both sever costs and creators?

OnlyFans pays 80% of their income to their creators and keeps 20% for their own operating costs. On OnlyFans, there's a "per channel subscription" with highly varying prices but a common price is around 5$/month.
So, before subscribing to a new channel one does have to think about whether it's one channel alone is worth it. these 5$/month. If you want to support several artists, it easily gets expensive.
It's quite similar on Patreon. Often, there are different pledge tiers offering different perks. Those who pay more get more "behind the scenes" stuff, early access to content, or access to restricted chat platforms.

Buying content online isn't new. One of the biggest content-creating companies these days does not sell any content. It streams it.
Streaming services became so incredible successful because they are easy to use. If you want to watch a movie, you don't have to buy it. You don't have to burden of handling a credit card every time you want to watch something.
And semi-legal streaming sites that were very popular 10 years ago didn't disappear because of harsh copyright enforecement, but because they are annoying. Ads are annoying. Netflix is less annoying. There is neither a wall of ads to fight every time one wants to watch something, nor does it make me find my credit card every time I want to watch something.
It is a reasonable priced quite payable[?] streaming service, with a wide range of things I can watch and very easy to use.

What if social media became similar to that? What if the internet people we really like would be just supported by us following them? Not just in some emotional way but actually substantially so they are able to pay their bills with just the money they make by us enjoying their content?

I guess it would mean the "enemy observation" would disappear. No one would give money to people they see as their enemies.
It sure does not solve all political debates. But maybe it would make social media less toxic by removing "enemy observation", as well as ads. (Ads are, after all, annoying and annoyance easily becomes aggression that will influence the platform itself.)

Social media is however quite the public sphere these days. There are many debates about companies like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube being gatekeepers to the public sphere. Particularely in a pandemic world where human gatherings have become health risks, we are even more dependant on some kind of social media to conntect and to keep the public debate alive. So, pushing them more into another for-profit model doesn't seen reasonable to me.

So, what if that social media flatrate wouldn't be platform-specific but rather protocol-specific?
What if there wouldn't be one company collection the 20% for server costs and development but instead we would have a community run these servers themselves?
What if the social media flatrate would be part of the fediverse?

Mastodon was quite a hype two years ago and yet, outside of the nerd bubble, it didn't really catch on. Nowadays servers are even closing - a common occurance in the some "host it yourself!" attitude[?]. As long as it's new and novel, it's fun to play around with one's own server. But after some time, it's not interesting anymore and it just becomes work to maintain it.
So what, if that social media flatrate would be part of mastodon? What if running a server would actually bring some income, depending on how many people use your server?

It would create several solutions: 
* one: not having one central company controlling everything but lots instances with their own policies. So it would be suiteable for porn people as well as for "no adult content"-people - other servers having other policies. If you don't want any porn content, use a server that doesn't allow any porn and blocks it.
* two: Some people are really great at creating content, so they have lots of followers and get paid that way. Other people may be not that great in creating content but are very competent in managing servers, so their server runs very smooth and has lots of users. And they get paid that way - so they have an incentive to host that server not just for a few months but permanently.
* three: It would make a platform possible without ads and without "enemy oberservation", so maybe also a way less toxic one. And it wouldn't create one big gatekeeper but instead lots of servers and people may choose the policy that fits them best.
Sure, it does not solve the big political conflicts. It will probably not eradicate white suprimacy, racism or sexism. But it might create another perspective on things when not the most controversial one is pushed the hardest but the one with the most support.

Now, that all may sound very nice. And I'd love to have the resources to make this happen. Sadly I currently don't have them. Not the time, not energy and also not the money to buy me the time it might need to setup something like this properly.
I have lots of ideas where to start to work on a social media flatrate - e.g. talk with <a href="https://eyeo.com/">eyeo</a> - the company owning <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a>. I'm not sure if Flattr is the right point to start such a thing but at least talking with them would make that clear. And Flattr is already quite similar to what I have in mind.
Or with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a>. I could imagine there could be a lot of common ground and they might be interested in developing some test case.
Or maybe with the Mastodon Community (Or their <a href="https://zeonfederated.com/">main developper</a>).
Maybe it is also something one should just start developing themself. Generally I'm not convinced with creating big projects all by yourself… and my programming skills are not up for such a big thing.

I have been thinking about all of this for the past few months, but currently I need to focus on my degree (If I'm not done by next summer, I will have to invest another year on it, or never get any degree). And also need to earn money. Which lately became a bit of a hustle.
So I'm putting it out here and hope someone will find it and work on it. I'd be happy to help to assist with it too but, for now, I can't realize the idea myself.

It could also be that the very idea of a social media flatrate is completely bogus. If so I'd be happy to hear proper arguments why the very idea is bad. Or what I missed thinking about it.

(And as it will come anyway: free in free software does not mean free as in free beer. It means free as in freedom. Yes, paying for a service a quite a burden and the public sphere needs to be free. Payment might be a very visible barrier but is by for not the only one. Not standing the toxic culture of twitter these days is a high barrier too. People not having the energy to withstand that much toxic are practically banned from the platform. In Germany we have a public broadcaster that need to be paid by all citizens in Germany too, as creating good content is expensive.
There is no world without barriers. The question is what barriers we pick.)
